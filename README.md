# OpenCV Builder for Linux

***
## BIG UPDATE:
I maded a script shell which can build [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) for android development in Linux, I don't need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) anymore to build a C++ project in [Android](https://developer.android.com/)!

**DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE NDK PATH IN ANDROID SCRIPT SHELL IF YOU HAD INSTALL NDK BEFORE!!**
****

I make this shell script to automate [`opencv`](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/) and [`opencv_contrib`](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/) tasks like downloading, install and post installation commands.

## One Command:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seven-7Up/opencv-installerForLinux/master/install-opencv.sh | sudo bash
```

## For checking-chicken(lol):

Lot of people like check everything before use it. No problem, few commands to run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Seven-7Up/opencv-installerForLinux.git

# For vim users (me too ;))
vi install-opencv.sh
# nano users
nano install-opencv.sh
# sublime
subl install-opencv.sh
# vscode
code install-opencv.sh
```
